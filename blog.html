              <p><b>var : </b> Variables declared with var can have a global or local scope. Global scope is for variables declared outside functions, while local scope is for variables declared inside functions. The scope of a var variable is functional scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.</p>

              <p><b>let :</b>  Variables declared with let can have a global, local, or block scope. Block scope is for variables declared in a block. It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.</p>

              <p><b>const :</b>  Const is different from var and let. const is used for declaring constant variables. Const variables has values that cannot be changed. So It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. Attempting such would throw an error.</p>
              <h6>We shouldn't use var anymore. We should use let or const instead of var.</h6>

              <p><b>Undefined :</b> Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. <br>
               <b>Null :</b> Null means an empty value or a blank value. The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>

                What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content bg-[#91C8E4]"> 
              <p><b>REST API :</b> A REST API is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer. REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways. So, A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.</p>
